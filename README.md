# python-projects
The various python projects I have created either for school, work or on my free time.

"CUNY_Athlete_Heights" 
is a project that aims to scrape the heights of men and women athletes from CUNY's volleyball and swimming team rosters across the country. The program will then compile a dataframe for all the names and heights of the players in their respective categories and output the data as a CSV file. In addition, the program will print the average heights of each dataframe and find the top five tallest and shortest players in each dataframe.

"Openweathermap API"
is a project that aims to utilize the Openweathermap API to receive at least 5 pieces of weather information for each of the top 11 U.S. cities by population. The data will be turned into a dataframe and exported to a CSV file.

"Top_Movies"
is a project that aims to not only scrape the top movies according IMDb and create a dataframe out of it, but also run each movie title through OMDb API. The data returned from the API and scraped from IMDb will be combined into a single dataframe to be exported as a CSV file. In addition, the code will print descriptional statistics on the combined dataframe.

"Valorant_Player_Stats"
is a project that aims to scrape various types of player data from the top performing Valorant players. The data will then be turned into a dataframe to export as a CSV file. In addition, the code will print description statistics for the player stats.
